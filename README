To add this overlay to a Gentoo system, run the following command:

layman -o https://raw.github.com/ryao/pipelight-overlay/master/overlay.xml -f -a pipelight

Note that you must have both dev-vcs/git and app-portage/layman installed on
your system for this to work.

Once the overlay is added, installation of pipelight requires keywording a few
packages and running emerge.

mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
echo 'app-emulation/wine-compholio ~*' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/pipelight-overlay
echo '=www-plugin/pipelight-9999 **' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/pipelight-overlay

emerge =www-plugin/pipelight-9999
